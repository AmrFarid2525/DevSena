<h3><b>AI based accident detection system</b></h3>
<h4>The problem</h4>
According to a data, around one and a half lakh persons die due to road accidents per year in India alone . 30-40% of these road accidents goes unnoticed or neglected by the general public to avoid the unwanted enquiry that can cost lives of several people.

The delay in the response time to these accidents leads to delayed arrival of ambulance or fire brigade to the spot. In these critical situations every second counts for the life.

There is not any concrete step to stop the loss of lives due to such road accidents.



We are providing a system to integrate with the CCTV cameras of roads and provide a quick response to accident victim<br/>

Accident happens + facts x number of death due to road accident happens y% die due to late response by the tespective authority
People fear+ many places like highway there are no people to make a complain neither police
There are CCTV installed but very few people are assigned to very large recordings
We are providing a system to integrate with the CCTV cameras of roads and provide a quick response to accident victim
Computer Vision with deep learing is used on a dataset of about 1000 road accidents.
We were suggested to include more features to it such as using the same for robbery detection,fire etc

## Technologies Used

## WorkFlow
* The data set is resized,added in to a vector,normalised between values of 0 and 1,convoluted pooled ,flattened ,to extract the important featured and reduce rhe vector size of the input.
* We have used a normal CNN and aiming to use better algorithm such as resNet to improve the accuracy
* The cleaned data is fed in to a neural network to classify if an accident has happened or not
